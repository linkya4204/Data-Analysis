This folder is the collection of 10 SQL popular queries that I follwed and solved via TFQ channel.
- Problem statement: straight from the TFQ channel himself. The excel describes the input and expected output for each problem.
- SQL file: I included the datasets and solution I did to solve the issue in each SQL file.
  Because TFQ used postgresql and I use MySQL so I had to modify the dataset so it will work with MySQL Workbench.
  For Question 9, the dataset is quite large so I put the dataset in separate file and the solution in another one.
