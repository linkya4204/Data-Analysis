UK Road Safety: Traffic Accidents and Vehicles

The UK government collects and publishes (usually on an annual basis) detailed information about traffic accidents across the country. 
This information includes, but is not limited to, geographical locations, weather conditions, type of vehicles, number of casualties and vehicle manoeuvres, making this a very interesting and comprehensive dataset for analysis and research.

The dataset was download from this GitHub account: https://github.com/ptyadana/SQL-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-Projects/tree/master/Database%20Clinics%20-%20MySQL/02.UK%20Road%20Safty%20Accidents%202015
along with the excel sheet to explain the data.

The accident severity in Accident file is only listed with number 1,2,3.
So I created one more table to link the code with the label I retrieved from the excel file.
